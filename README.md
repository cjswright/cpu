# Pipelined CPU for Wramp

This implements a pipelined CPU for the Wramp architecture.

Very WIP!

# Building

Use CMake to build in the usual way:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -GNinja ..
ninja
```

... alternatively use the run.sh script which will do all of that for
you, run the linter, and run the simulation:

```
./run.sh
```
